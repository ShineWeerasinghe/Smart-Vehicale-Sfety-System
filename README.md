# Smart-Vehicale-Sfety-System
A smart vehicle safety system using ESP32, sensors, GPS, and GSM. It detects alcohol, obstacles, overheating, and collisions, then sends emergency alerts with location. Built for my IDP at General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University, this project focuses on enhancing road safety through real-time monitoring and IoT integration.
